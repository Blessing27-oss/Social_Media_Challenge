# DartConnect

## Description

DartConnect is a social media platform designed to help Dartmouth students connect with others across different departments and geographical regions. The platform allows users to create profiles that display basic information, interests, and favorite aspects of their life. It also serves as a tool for students to find peers with similar hobbies, academic interests, or extracurricular passions.

Additionally, the platform includes a Statistics Section, where departments across campus can gather insights and data about student demographics and preferences, which can be useful for organizing events, improving student engagement, and enhancing the overall Dartmouth community experience.

## Learning Journey

### What inspired you to create this project?
I've always been passionate about creating platforms that bring people together in meaningful ways. For this project, I wanted to build a platform that emphasizes the big smiles and personalities of the usersâ€”something that helps users showcase their true selves. I envisioned a space where profiles aren't just about basic information, but also about conveying warmth and character, giving others a welcoming experience to truly get to know the person behind the profile.

Though its still under construction, my focus was on creating authentic, personable connections shaped the design and features of the platform. By allowing students to highlight their interests and passions, the app becomes a space for self-expression and genuine connections, rather than just a tool for networking.

### What potential impact do you believe it could have on its intended users or the broader community?

This platform could provide a safe space for people to find others in a meaningful way and build new relationships. Though its still under construction the aim was to integrate real-time communication features and social media engagement, I hope to foster a relationships/friendships that thrives on collaboration.

### What new technology did you learn?

Throughout this project, I learned to work with React Native for building a website and Node.js for backend services, including database management. 

### Why did you choose the new technology?

I chose React Native because it allows for cross-platform development, meaning I could build the app for both iOS and Android with a single codebase. 

### Challenges you faced, and what you learned from the experience:

One of the biggest challenges I faced was connecting the back-end with the front-end seamlessly. Initially, I had difficulty integrating real-time data updates and making sure the user interface (UI) reflected changes from the back-end immediately. The asynchronous nature of working with APIs and the database system was particularly tricky for me.
